    Intel provides a bunch of (non-architectural) performance monitoring events to count uops.
    I have been trying to use the ones related to cache behavior of loads in a loadable kernel module.
    The odd thing is, even though the LKM is operating on ring-0,
    the performance monitoring events that I program to count ring-0 events are not working
    when it comes to uop related events.
    Switching to user level, however, gives (somewhat) meaningful data.
    I am convinced that it might be a possible bug in Sandy Bridge processors.
    
    The following should work, but it does not. All it reads from PMC0 is 0.
    If the value written to the \verb|PERFEVTSEL0| is changed to \verb|0x4181D0|,
    then the results become non-zero.
